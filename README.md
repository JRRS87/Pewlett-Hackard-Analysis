# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis is to conduct a Database analysis for Pewlett Hackard with detailed information on the number of 
future retirees from all departments currently working at the company to be able to prepare a plan to hire new staff and also 
to prepare a mentorship initiative. 

The criterion was based on the birth dates ranging from 1952 to 1955 and hired dates from 1985 to 1988.

In order to ensure a smooth transition this analysis focuses on the following:

- Identify the retiring employees by their title.
- Determine the sum of retiring employees grouped by title.
- Identify the employees eligible for participation in the mentorship program.
- Determine the number of roles-to-fill grouped by title and department.
- Determine the number of qualified, retirement-ready employees to mentor the next generation grouped by title and department.

## Background

The data is gathered in six CSV files and the analysis is performed using relational databases. In this analysis I am using:

- QuickDBD to create quick database design for better visualization,
- PostreSQL a database system to load, build and host companyâ€™s data, and
- pgAdmin a GUI, using SQL Language to explore, manipulate and extract the data.

## Results

There are 90,398 employees retiring

Of those employees , there are 29,414 Senior Engineers, 28,254 Senior Staff, 14,222 Engineers, 12,243 Staff, 4,502 Technique 
Leaders, 1,761 Assistant Engineers, and 2 Managers.

There are 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship program
Of those eligible employees, there are 402 Engineers, 392 Senior Staff, 332 Staff, 290 Senior Engineers, 77 Technique Leaders, 
and 56 Assistant Engineers.

## Summary

At the moment at Pewlett Hackard, 64% of their employees are getting ready for retirement or being redirected to their mentorship 
initiatives, which will mean that they are likely going to need an extensive hiring process in the upcoming years. Since a significant
amount of future retirees hold Senior positions the mentorship program should provide a capacitation buffer for the extensive 
expertise that will be leaving the company in the years to come.
